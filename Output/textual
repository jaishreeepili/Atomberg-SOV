Key Competitors (High level)
•	Havells — strong secondary presence; often co-mentioned with Atomberg in comparison discussions.
•	Crompton — competitive in energy-saving positioning; appears in BLDC upgrade/DIY content.
•	Orient, Usha, Bajaj, Luminous — appear in “best fan” listicles and price-sensitive segments.
Topic-Level Positioning
Energy Saving (BLDC, electricity bill, watts): Atomberg leads in mentions and positive sentiment.; Strong alignment with BLDC and “save electricity” narrative.
Implication: Atomberg currently owns the energy-efficiency story. This is a core brand strength that should be reinforced.
Smart Features (Wi-Fi, Alexa, app control, Google Home)
•	Atomberg is strongly associated with “smart fan” and “remote/app/Alexa”.
•	Many titles and descriptions tie Atomberg to smart control and automation.
Implication: There is clear potential to deepen the smart home integration story: automations, routines, use cases.
 
Noise / Silent Operation
•	Mixed picture. Atomberg appears in some “silent fan” contexts, but:
•	A few high-engagement videos present negative narratives around sound/noise for certain models.
Implication: “Silent fan” is currently a vulnerable topic where competitors can challenge Atomberg if negative content is not addressed.
 
Price / Value
•	Comments mention both “value for money” and “expensive” for Atomberg.
•	In “best fan under X budget” videos, Atomberg competes closely with Orient, Crompton, Bajaj, etc.
Implication: Atomberg needs clearer ROI communication: long-term bill savings vs upfront cost.
 
3. High-Risk Content (Needs Response)
Example high-risk videos flagged by the agent:
1.	Shorts/reels complaining about Atomberg Studio Smart Plus fan noise
o	High engagement per day
o	Sentiment score for Atomberg around -1.0 (strongly negative)
2.	“Best Ceiling Fan 2025 / Best BLDC Fan” type videos
o	Atomberg appears, but comments include mixed or negative views on noise and price
o	High engagement, likely to shape purchase decisions
Recommended Actions:
•	Add official pinned comments under these videos addressing common concerns (installation issues, balance, speeds, etc.).
•	Create Myth-busting / troubleshooting content titled around noise issues and how to fix them.
•	Offer direct support links in responses to those videos.
 
4. High-Opportunity Content (Where Atomberg Was Missing)
The agent identified high-engagement videos mentioning only competitors (e.g., Crompton, Orient, Bajaj) with no Atomberg mention, such as:
•	BLDC upgrade tutorials
•	“Best ceiling fan 2025” listicles
•	Smart/innovative ceiling fan showcase videos
Recommended Actions:
•	Create comparison content:
o	“Atomberg vs Crompton BLDC — which actually saves more electricity?”
o	“Best smart fan 2025 — including Atomberg vs X vs Y”
•	Consider collaborations or outreach to creators whose videos currently omit Atomberg but have strong audience engagement.
 
5. Strategic Recommendations (Actionable Summary)
1.	Double down on Energy-Saving Leadership
o	More content explicitly tying kWh savings → monthly bill reductions
o	Visual calculators: “This is how much you save in 1 year with Atomberg vs a normal fan”
2.	Systematically Address Noise-Related Negatives
o	Publish short technical videos explaining causes and fixes for fan noise.
o	Respond under key negative videos with troubleshooting guidance + support.
o	Use internal docs to highlight design optimizations that reduce sound.
3.	Own the Smart Home Fan Narrative
o	Tutorials: “Automate your Atomberg fan with Alexa/Google Home”
o	“5 smart automations with your Atomberg fan”
o	Position Atomberg as the default smart fan for the modern home.
4.	Clarify Price vs Value Story
o	Use data: “Atomberg saves up to X per year, paying back the price difference in Y months.”
o	Include this in titles and thumbnails: “Pays for itself in 1 year”.
5.	Leverage Independent Creators (Strong Organic Base)
o	Since Atomberg already has strong presence among independent creators,
create a lightweight “Creator Club”:
	Early access to models
	Engineering Q&A sessions
	Feature top creators in Atomberg’s own channels
6.	Turn This Agent into a Reusable Internal Tool
o	Run the script periodically (e.g., monthly) to track SoV over time.
o	Compare before/after metrics as new campaigns/content go live.
o	Extend later to other platforms (Instagram Reels, X, etc.).
